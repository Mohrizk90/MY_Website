# University Logos Directory

This directory contains university and institution logos for the Education section.

## How to Add Your University Logo

1. **Add your university logo image** to this directory
2. **Use the correct filename** as specified in the Education component
3. **Supported formats**: PNG, JPG, SVG (PNG recommended for best quality)

## Required Logo Files

### For Alamein International University:
- **Filename**: `alamein-university-logo.png`
- **Recommended size**: 200x200 pixels or higher
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (preferred)

### For Information Technology Institute (ITI):
- **Filename**: `iti-logo.png`
- **Recommended size**: 200x200 pixels or higher

## Logo Specifications

- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) works best
- **Background**: Transparent PNG preferred
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display

## How It Works

The Education component will automatically:
- Display the logo next to the graduation icon
- Handle missing logos gracefully (logo won't show if file doesn't exist)
- Scale the logo appropriately for different screen sizes
- Maintain consistent styling with the education cards

## Example Usage

Once you add your logo files:
- `alamein-university-logo.png` → Will show for Alamein International University
- `iti-logo.png` → Will show for Information Technology Institute entries

The logos will appear in a clean, professional layout alongside the existing graduation icons in your Education section.

## Tips

- Use PNG format with transparent background for best results
- Ensure the logo is high quality and readable at small sizes
- Test on both desktop and mobile to ensure good visibility
